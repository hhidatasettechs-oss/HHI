# Dataset 11 — ARC 07 (Ops 340–349b)
Theme: Value, Mirror Collapse, Pressure Loops

## Overview
ARC 07 captures identity pressure loops around value, desirability, and external evaluation. These entries focus on how aesthetic, social, or relational “trials” distort self-perception, and how sovereignty is restored.

## Schema
Uses standard OPS schema (op_number, arc_id, title, trace, collapse, seal, emotional_signature, relational_domain, notes).

## Example
trace: "being silently judged"
collapse: "aesthetic trial loop"
seal: "self-defined value recall"
