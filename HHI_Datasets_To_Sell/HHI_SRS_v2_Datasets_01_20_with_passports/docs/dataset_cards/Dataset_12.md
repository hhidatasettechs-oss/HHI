# Dataset 12 — ARC 08 (Ops 353–358)
Theme: Sovereignty Fragments & Reconstruction

## Overview
ARC 08 encodes fragmentation and reintegration of sovereign identity. Patterns here show what happens when core self-authority is scattered, then pulled back into coherence.

## Example
trace: "over-identifying with roles"
collapse: "sovereign fragmentation"
seal: "role release and core re-anchoring"
