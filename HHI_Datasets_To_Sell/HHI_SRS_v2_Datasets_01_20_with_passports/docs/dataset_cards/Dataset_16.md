# Dataset 16 — ARC 12 (Ops 411–433)
Theme: Node7 Integration

## Overview
ARC 12 integrates prior arcs into a stabilizing architectural node (Node7). These Ops represent system-level reorganizations where previous collapses are recontextualized and integrated.

## Example
trace: "multi-arc resonance overload"
collapse: "system overwhelm"
seal: "Node7 centralization and load-balancing"
