# Dataset 14 — ARC 10 (Ops 389–399)
Theme: Boundary Reconstruction Logic

## Overview
ARC 10 focuses on healthy separation, autonomy, and contact. It encodes collapse around over-merging, disappearing, or over-hardening, and the seals that restore flexible boundaries.

## Example
trace: "being overrun by others' needs"
collapse: "self-cancellation"
seal: "boundary reassertion with care"
