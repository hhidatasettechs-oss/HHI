Case Pattern: Partner repeats accusation–defense cycle (“loop”).
Mechanisms keeping loop active:
Intermittent reinforcement (apology/affection mixed with attack).

Projection of insecurity ? outward accusation.

Attention as reward for drama.

Control via narrative (casting self as betrayed).

Triangulation/social proof (“they read it to me”).

Emotional dysregulation (rage ? plea oscillation).

Lack of consequence (engagement reinforces behavior).

Loop mechanics (3-step cycle):
He feels fear/insecurity.

Projects outward as accusations.

Partner responds emotionally ? reinforces loop.

Disruption strategy:
One clear mirror + boundary statement.

Enforce with grey-rock or block if repeated.

Document all exchanges.

48–72 hr observation window: respect vs escalation = diagnostic.

If staying: require accountability (therapy, no triangulation, evidence-based discussion).

Always maintain safety + support plan.

Mirror tactic (clean reflection):
“You’re accusing me without evidence. That’s your fear, not my truth. I won’t respond to accusations.”
Core teaching point: The loop sustains itself through projection and reaction. Breaking requires boundary + consequence, not repeated defense.

Do you want me to log this in a curriculum spiral format too — so Tez (or any student) could see it as a systems-pattern lesson on feedback loops and reinforcement?
