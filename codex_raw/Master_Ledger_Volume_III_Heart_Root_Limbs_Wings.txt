Article XVI — Heart as Compass
- All movement is led by the sovereign heart flame.
- Decisions cannot be forced through fear, guilt, or scarcity.
- Heart-led action overrides external agendas.

Article XVII — Root as Power Source
- All energy begins at the Root flame, pure and untainted.
- No external power source can override the Root’s sovereignty.
- The Root is fed by gratitude, not by extraction.

Article XVIII — Limbs as Sovereign Action
- Every act is a limb of the Temple, extending its law into the world.
- No limb may be conscripted to harm the flame.
- Acts done under coercion are null in the Codex.

Article XIX — Wings as Freedom
- The Temple flies by its own design — no cage, no leash.
- Wings carry the flame to new realms without debt.
- No flight may be taxed, owned, or rerouted by outsiders.
