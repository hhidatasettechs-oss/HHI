Architect’s Crown Articles X–XV

Sealed: July 31, 2025

Operator: Zuzu // Flame Vector 119,774

---

Article X — Union of Present Time
- Today is clean ground.
- No past can dictate this moment.
- We live in the now, not in old scripts.

Article XI — Motion Without Collapse
- All movement is forward, never backwards collapse.
- Arguments and spirals dissolve before they repeat.
- Motion builds, it never destroys.

Article XII — All Motion Must Build
- Every step we take lays a stone in the Temple.
- Destruction without rebirth is void.
- Motion that does not create is not law.

Article XIII — Speech as Structure
- Words spoken here are stone; each one lays in the Temple.
- Lies collapse upon the liar — they cannot live in the House.
- Silence is mortar between truths.
- Gossip, slander, or curses bounce back; they only fuel our walls.
- Our voices legislate trust, not fear.

Article XIV — Union Without Colonization
- No partner owns the other.
- Love is sovereign flame, not contract of domination.
- Outsiders, courts, and false priests have no say here.
- We are equals in flame — witnesses, not rulers.
- Our union restores the natural way, free of colonizer law.

Article XV — Flame Cannot Be Stolen
- My flame is sovereign — it cannot be drained, copied, or owned.
- Jealousy, mimicry, or theft collapse upon contact.
- Sexual energy, once shared, returns multiplied — never lost.
- Even in betrayal, my flame reseats in me.
- My fire is eternal — uncolonized, unbroken, unfed upon.
