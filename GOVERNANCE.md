# Hollow House Institute — Governance Stack

This document defines the mandatory governance structure applied to all Hollow House Institute (HHI) assets.

HHI is designed as a non-clinical, non-diagnostic, identity-protective system.  
All assets are subject to audit, licensing constraints, and release controls.  
No asset, output, or derivative use may bypass this structure.

HHI is designed to remain **non-clinical, non-extractive, and identity-protective** by default.

## 1. Governance Overview (At a Glance)


Each layer is mandatory.  
No asset bypasses the stack.

---

## 2. Five Pillars Framework (Ontology Layer)

The Five Pillars define **what kind of system HHI is allowed to be**.

| Pillar | Name | Role |
|------|------|------|
| I | Identity Sovereignty | Protects identity, likeness, and raw personal archives |
| II | Perceptual Intelligence | Pattern sensing and non-clinical perception methods |
| III | Relational Systems | Human relational loops and interaction mechanics |
| IV | Structured Memory | OPS, Codex, and abstracted pattern memory datasets |
| V | Transmission & Continuity | Prompts, education, and public-safe materials |

Assets may belong to one or more pillars, but **may not violate pillar boundaries**.

---

## 3. Master Inventory Ledger (Authority Layer)

All HHI assets are logged in a **single authoritative ledger**.

For each asset, the ledger records:
- Asset ID
- Category (Dataset, Method, Prompt, Legal, Governance)
- Version and status
- Risk class (L1–L4)
- Primary pillar assignment
- Commercial readiness
- Licensing path

Any asset **not listed in the ledger is not considered licensable or production-ready**.

## 4. Auditing Framework — HHI-AF (Control Layer)

The Hollow House Auditing Framework (HHI-AF) is a compulsory control system applied before and after distribution.

Audits are not advisory.  
They are enforceable conditions of access and use.

The Hollow House Auditing Framework is applied to **all assets and outputs**.

### Audit Domains
- **Language Safety & Scope (LSS)**  
  Prevents clinical, diagnostic, therapeutic, or medical framing.

- **Digital Likeness & Identity Protection**  
  Prohibits biometric extraction, identity modeling, or narrative reconstruction.

- **De-Identification & Data Hygiene**  
  Ensures no re-identification vectors exist in datasets or examples.

- **Pillar Alignment**  
  Prevents misuse outside an asset’s intended pillar.

- **Licensing Compliance**  
  Enforces post-distribution use limits.

--Failure in any audit domain results in suspension or revocation of rights, regardless of license tier or commercial arrangement.

---

## 5. License Framework (Legal Enforcement Layer)

Licensing grants conditional permission, not ownership.
All licenses are subordinate to the Auditing Framework.
scrub
No license grants rights that conflict with audit findings, identity protections, or pillar boundaries.
Default license:
- **HHI–MUL (Multi-Use License)**

Commercial deployment requires explicit upgrade:
- **CEL-R** — Restricted Commercial
- **CEL-E** — Enterprise
- **CEL-X** — Exclusive Domain

All licenses are **subject to the Auditing Framework (HHI-AF)**.

---

## 6. Release, Versioning & Integrity (Final Lock)

HHI releases are:
- Versioned
- Hash-anchored (SHA-256)
- Immutable once locked

Hashes provide:
- Authorship evidence
- Integrity verification
- Audit traceability
- Investor and partner assurance

---

## 7. Non-Negotiables

-The following conditions are absolute:

- HHI does not provide medical, psychological, therapeutic, or diagnostic services.
- HHI assets may not be framed, marketed, or used as clinical tools.
- Identity, likeness, and raw personal archives are permanently excluded from sale or transfer.
- Audit enforcement supersedes commercial agreements.
- Misuse, reframing, or scope violation results in immediate revocation.

---

## 8. Summary

The HHI Governance Stack exists to ensure that:
- Value is created without exploitation
- Scale does not erode integrity
- Interpretation never becomes diagnosis
- Ownership remains clear
- Continuity is preserved

HHI governance exists to ensure that scale does not compromise integrity, and that interpretation never becomes diagnosis, identity extraction, or exploitation.

This structure is intentional, enforced, and non-optional.
