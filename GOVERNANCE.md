# Hollow House Institute — Governance Stack

This document describes how Hollow House Institute (HHI) assets are **governed, protected, audited, and licensed**.  
It is intentionally structural, not promotional.

HHI is designed to remain **non-clinical, non-extractive, and identity-protective** by default.

---

## 1. Governance Overview (At a Glance)


Each layer is mandatory.  
No asset bypasses the stack.

---

## 2. Five Pillars Framework (Ontology Layer)

The Five Pillars define **what kind of system HHI is allowed to be**.

| Pillar | Name | Role |
|------|------|------|
| I | Identity Sovereignty | Protects identity, likeness, and raw personal archives |
| II | Perceptual Intelligence | Pattern sensing and non-clinical perception methods |
| III | Relational Systems | Human relational loops and interaction mechanics |
| IV | Structured Memory | OPS, Codex, and abstracted pattern memory datasets |
| V | Transmission & Continuity | Prompts, education, and public-safe materials |

Assets may belong to one or more pillars, but **may not violate pillar boundaries**.

---

## 3. Master Inventory Ledger (Authority Layer)

All HHI assets are logged in a **single authoritative ledger**.

For each asset, the ledger records:
- Asset ID
- Category (Dataset, Method, Prompt, Legal, Governance)
- Version and status
- Risk class (L1–L4)
- Primary pillar assignment
- Commercial readiness
- Licensing path

Any asset **not listed in the ledger is not considered licensable or production-ready**.

---

## 4. Auditing Framework — HHI-AF (Control Layer)

The Hollow House Auditing Framework is applied to **all assets and outputs**.

### Audit Domains
- **Language Safety & Scope (LSS)**  
  Prevents clinical, diagnostic, therapeutic, or medical framing.

- **Digital Likeness & Identity Protection**  
  Prohibits biometric extraction, identity modeling, or narrative reconstruction.

- **De-Identification & Data Hygiene**  
  Ensures no re-identification vectors exist in datasets or examples.

- **Pillar Alignment**  
  Prevents misuse outside an asset’s intended pillar.

- **Licensing Compliance**  
  Enforces post-distribution use limits.

Audit failure triggers **immediate suspension or revocation**.

---

## 5. License Framework (Legal Enforcement Layer)

Default license:
- **HHI–MUL (Multi-Use License)**

Commercial deployment requires explicit upgrade:
- **CEL-R** — Restricted Commercial
- **CEL-E** — Enterprise
- **CEL-X** — Exclusive Domain

All licenses are **subject to the Auditing Framework (HHI-AF)**.

---

## 6. Release, Versioning & Integrity (Final Lock)

HHI releases are:
- Versioned
- Hash-anchored (SHA-256)
- Immutable once locked

Hashes provide:
- Authorship evidence
- Integrity verification
- Audit traceability
- Investor and partner assurance

---

## 7. Non-Negotiables

- HHI is **not** therapy, medicine, or diagnosis.
- Identity and likeness assets are **never sold**.
- Raw personal archives are **never released**.
- Audit enforcement overrides commercial pressure.
- Attribution is mandatory.
- Misuse results in revocation.

---

## 8. Summary

The HHI Governance Stack exists to ensure that:
- Value is created without exploitation
- Scale does not erode integrity
- Interpretation never becomes diagnosis
- Ownership remains clear
- Continuity is preserved

This structure is intentional and permanent.
