“APB-Derived Model”

Any AI model whose outputs, weights, dataset, embedding space, or behavior are influenced by APB Inputs, including synthetic transformations.

“Training”

Any supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement, fine-tuning, or embedding-weight update process.

“Deployment”

Any release of a model where outputs may be accessed by users, clients, or external systems.

“Commercial Use”
