# ⭐ PART 1 — MY BLENDED REVENUE ENGINE

This is the **D structure**: volume + enterprises + exclusives.

i will run **all four license tiers** simultaneously:

---

## **TIER 1 — APB–MUL (Low Ticket Volume)**

Price: **$29–$199**

Purpose:

* Attract buyers fast
* Build a customer base
* Prove demand
* Create a pipeline for upsell

These convert into CEL-R buyers.

---

## **TIER 2 — CEL-R (Mid Ticket, High Frequency)**

Price: **$499–$4,999**

This will be my **bread-and-butter income**.

These buyers are:

* indie devs
* creators
* therapists with apps
* wellness-tech solopreneurs
* AI coaches
* small startups

They need model-training rights but not enterprise features.

---

## **TIER 3 — CEL-E (Enterprise Licensing)**

Price: **$5,000–$45,000**

These are:

* AI labs
* mental health platforms
* coaching-tech companies
* LLM startups
* wellness AI companies
* R&D teams
* universities

They want:

* commercial deployment
* internal tool rights
* team-wide use
* API/SaaS permissions

This is my **consistent high-income layer**.

---

## **TIER 4 — CEL-X (Exclusive Domain Rights)**

Price: **$50,000–$500,000**

This is my *king tier*.

Each domain can be sold **once**:

* Relationship Intelligence AI
* Nervous System Mapping AI
* Digital Likeness Protection AI
* Toxic → Healthy Transformation AI
* Somatic Cognition AI
* Relational Safety Auditing AI
* OPS Pattern Intelligence

One sale can pay **six figures**.

---

# ⭐ PART 2 — 90-DAY BLENDED REVENUE PLAN

This is the schedule companies follow when they launch a dataset lab.

---

## **Days 1–30: Quick Cash + Build Pipeline**

Goal: **$8,000 – $25,000**

Actions:

* release APB–MUL publicly
* soft launch CEL-R to your warm network
* pitch 1–2 CEL-E to early adopters
* begin conversations around ONE CEL-X domain

Deliverables:

* pricing page
* GitHub repos (done)
* dataset samples (done)
* commercial license suite (done)

---

## **Days 31–60: Enterprise Penetration**

Goal: **$25,000 – $80,000**

Actions:

* pitch 10–20 companies for CEL-E
* close 2–4 enterprise licenses
* launch "Relational Intelligence Data Suite"
* launch "Digital Likeness Protection Framework"

Deliverables:

* enterprise PDF brochure
* inbound website
* targeted outbound to niche sectors
* evaluate which CEL-X domain has most interest

---

## **Days 61–90: Exclusive Domain Sales**

Goal: **$75,000 – $250,000+**

Actions:

* negotiate 1–2 CEL-X exclusivity deals
* finalize 5–12 CEL-R deals
* launch V2 dataset bundles
* onboard enterprise clients

At this stage, i look like:

**a boutique behavioral-AI dataset firm

* digital likeness governance lab
* ops-pattern architecture company.**
