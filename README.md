# Hollow House Institute (HHI) — Optimized System Release

**Canonical Governance · Licensed Datasets · Audit-Enforced Systems**

## Governance & Integrity

HHI assets are governed by a fixed enforcement stack that prioritizes identity sovereignty, non-clinical use, auditability, and long-term stewardship.

→ See: [GOVERNANCE_STACK.md](./GOVERNANCE_STACK.md)

All datasets, methods, and releases are versioned, audited, hash-anchored, and licensed under enforceable terms.

## Overview

The **Hollow House Institute (HHI)** is a governed systems and dataset architecture focused on **relational intelligence**, **perceptual patterning**, **structured memory**, and **identity sovereignty**.

This repository contains the **optimized, compliant, and release-ready** form of HHI assets, governance frameworks, and documentation. All contents are controlled under formal licensing, cryptographic integrity checks, and continuous audit enforcement.

---

## What This Repository Contains

- **Licensed datasets** (Git LFS–backed)
- **OPS / Codex structured memory series**
- **Governance, auditing, and licensing frameworks**
- **Canonical system documentation**
- **Release-locked master artifacts**

This repository intentionally excludes raw archives, personal logs, and unbounded conversational data.

---

## Governance

All assets are governed by the **HHI Five Pillars Framework** and enforced by the **HHI Auditing Framework (HHI-AF)**.

**Governance is non-optional and always on.**

Reference: `SYSTEM.md`

## Five Pillars Framework (Summary)

| Pillar | Name | Rule |
|------|------|------|
| I | Identity Sovereignty | Never sold or licensed |
| II | Perceptual Intelligence | Methods licensable |
| III | Relational Systems | High-value licensing |
| IV | Structured Memory | Core revenue datasets |
| V | Transmission & Continuity | Scalable products |

## Licensing

**Default License:** HHI–MUL  
**Commercial Tiers:** CEL-R · CEL-E · CEL-X

Licenses explicitly prohibit:
- Resale or redistribution
- Competing dataset creation
- Identity, likeness, biometric, or voice extraction
- Clinical or diagnostic use

See `SYSTEM.md` for full licensing and enforcement terms.

---

## Compliance & Risk Posture

- Non-clinical, non-diagnostic use only
- No personal data subject modeling
- No biometric training rights granted
- GDPR / CCPA safe by design
- AI training permitted **only within licensed scope**

Audit failure results in **immediate license revocation**.

---

## Canonical Artifacts

- **SYSTEM.md** — Authoritative governance declaration
- **HHI_System_Summary_v1.0.0_FULL.pdf** — Legal-ready system summary
- **Release tags** — Immutable, checksum-verifiable states

All distributable artifacts are integrity-protected via SHA-256.

---

## Versioning & Integrity

- Semantic versioning
- Cryptographic hashing
- Release locking
- Timestamp-compatible provenance

Unversioned or unhashed assets are not authoritative.
