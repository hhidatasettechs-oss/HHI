# Hollow House Institute (HHI)

HHI is a governed system for licensed datasets, methods, and interpretive tools focused on **non-clinical human pattern analysis**, **identity protection**, and **long-term stewardship**.

All assets are audited, versioned, hash-anchored, and licensed.  
No asset bypasses governance.

## What This Repository Contains

- Licensed datasets (abstracted, de-identified)
- Non-clinical methods and prompt libraries
- Governance, auditing, and licensing frameworks
- Versioned, integrity-anchored releases

Raw personal archives, identity materials, and likeness assets are **never** distributed.

## Governance & Integrity

HHI assets are governed by a fixed enforcement stack that prioritizes identity sovereignty, non-clinical use, auditability, and long-term stewardship.

→ See: [GOVERNANCE_STACK.md](./GOVERNANCE_STACK.md)

All datasets, methods, and releases are subject to mandatory audit, licensing constraints, and release controls.

## Non-Negotiable Scope

HHI is **not**:
- Medical, psychological, therapeutic, or diagnostic
- A substitute for professional care
- An identity or likeness modeling system
- An open dataset for scraping or redistribution

Patterns are descriptive, not diagnostic.  
Interpretation does not imply treatment, causation, or outcome.
